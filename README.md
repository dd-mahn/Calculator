Constructed using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project served as a pivotal milestone in my journey as a beginner developer. It was designed with the dual purpose of honing my skills in DOM management and enhancing my algorithmic mindset. Throughout this endeavor, I successfully acquired the ability to construct projects more efficiently, fine-tune my JavaScript proficiency, and cultivate code that is not only functional but also easily comprehensible.
